# minotaur-maze-py
A basic game I created in my first semester of university.

It currently doesn't have an end, or many comments or look particularly great, but it implements several interesting algorithms:
 - 2D Perlin Noise,
 - RLE,
 - LCG,
 - Middle-Square,
 - Graph Traversal (not fully implemented, and to be changed to A*),
 - Erosion and Dilation (on the generated map),
 
This game was writen in Python, as the use of tkinter was required by the brief, and I intend to improve and update it (probably in Java) in the future.
